# CPUTemperature

## About

Show temperature of CPU on status bar.

[Temperature Monitor](http://www.bresink.com/osx/TemperatureMonitor.html) does not work on my MacBook Air 11" Mid 2013, so I create this CPUTemperature.app with RubyCocoa.

## How to use

First, install [Temperature Monitor](http://www.bresink.com/osx/TemperatureMonitor.html). Because CPUTemperature internally uses "tempmonitor" command contained in Temperature Monitor.

Double click "CPUTemperature.app", then will display temperature of CPU on status bar.

## How to customize

```
vi CPUTemperature.app/Contents/MacOS/cpu-temperature.rb
```
